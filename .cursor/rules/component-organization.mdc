# Component Organization

The project uses a component-based architecture with React and shadcn/ui components.

## Component Structure

- UI components are located in `src/components/ui/`
- Feature-specific components are organized by feature in `src/components/`
- Strategy report components are in `src/components/strategyreportgenie/`

## Component Patterns

### UI Components
Base UI components from shadcn/ui are used as building blocks. These follow a consistent pattern:
- Each component is in its own directory with its variants
- Components use tailwind classes for styling
- Example: [src/components/ui/button.tsx](mdc:src/components/ui/button.tsx)

### Feature Components
Feature-specific components combine UI components to create more complex functionality:
- Components are grouped by feature or domain
- Each component follows a consistent naming pattern
- Example: [src/components/strategyreportgenie/ReportDashboard.tsx](mdc:src/components/strategyreportgenie/ReportDashboard.tsx)

### Pages
Page components represent complete views and are located in `src/pages/`:
- Pages use feature components to compose complete views
- Each page corresponds to a route in the application
- Example: [src/pages/StrategyReportGenie.tsx](mdc:src/pages/StrategyReportGenie.tsx)

## Component Naming

- Use PascalCase for component names
- Use descriptive names that indicate the component's purpose
- Suffixes like `Card`, `Panel`, `View`, or `Dashboard` help indicate the component's role

## UI Components

The application uses shadcn/ui components, which are located in `src/components/ui`. These are extended from Radix UI primitives.

Examples:
- [src/components/ui/button.tsx](mdc:src/components/ui/button.tsx)
- [src/components/ui/dialog.tsx](mdc:src/components/ui/dialog.tsx)

## Page Sections

Page sections are higher-level components specific to pages:

- [src/components/Hero.tsx](mdc:src/components/Hero.tsx) - Hero section on main landing page
- [src/components/Navbar.tsx](mdc:src/components/Navbar.tsx) - Navigation bar
- [src/components/Testimonials.tsx](mdc:src/components/Testimonials.tsx) - Testimonials section
- [src/components/WhyRoboQuant.tsx](mdc:src/components/WhyRoboQuant.tsx) - Features section

## Component Composition

Components are composed from smaller components:
- Hero is composed of HeroContent and VideoBackground
- UI components are used across all components

## Admin Components

Admin-specific components are prefixed with "Admin" and many are located in the `src/components/admin` directory.

## Protected Components

Protected routes use the [src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx](mdc:src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx) component to guard against unauthorized access.
