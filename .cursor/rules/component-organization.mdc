# Component Organization

This document outlines how components are organized in the RoboQuant Academy website.

## UI Components

The application uses shadcn/ui components, which are located in `src/components/ui`. These are extended from Radix UI primitives.

Examples:
- [src/components/ui/button.tsx](mdc:src/components/ui/button.tsx)
- [src/components/ui/dialog.tsx](mdc:src/components/ui/dialog.tsx)

## Page Sections

Page sections are higher-level components specific to pages:

- [src/components/Hero.tsx](mdc:src/components/Hero.tsx) - Hero section on main landing page
- [src/components/Navbar.tsx](mdc:src/components/Navbar.tsx) - Navigation bar
- [src/components/Testimonials.tsx](mdc:src/components/Testimonials.tsx) - Testimonials section
- [src/components/WhyRoboQuant.tsx](mdc:src/components/WhyRoboQuant.tsx) - Features section

## Component Composition

Components are composed from smaller components:
- Hero is composed of HeroContent and VideoBackground
- UI components are used across all components

## Admin Components

Admin-specific components are prefixed with "Admin" and many are located in the `src/components/admin` directory.

## Protected Components

Protected routes use the [src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx](mdc:src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx) component to guard against unauthorized access.
